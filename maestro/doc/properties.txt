== Terminator ==

The terminator is a separate thread that sends nodes Stop messages, which
cause them to stop immediately, without trying to wrap up nicely. It is
use to test the fault tolerance of Maestro.

The terminator is given a quotum, a floating point value, of nodes that
it can terminate, consisting of an initial quotum and an addition quotum
for each node that joins the system. After an initial sleep time, it sends
its Stop messages with a fixed time interval between the message. If
no initial sleep time is specified, the terminator is not run at all.

ibis.maestro.terminatorStartQuotum
   Initial quotum of nodes to terminate, typically a value below 1,
   so that on a single-node run that single node is not terminated.
   Default value is 0.5.

ibis.maestro.terminatorNodeQuotum
   Additional quotum for each node that is added to the computation.
   Normally a value below 1 so that not every node is killed.
   Default value is 0.1, so that eventually 10% of the nodes is stopped.

ibis.maestro.terminatorInitialSleepTime
   Initial sleep time of the terminator in milliseconds. If this value
   is not given, the terminator is not run.

ibis.maestro.terminatorSleepTime
   Sleep time between termination messages in milliseconds. Default
   is 100 (milliseconds).
