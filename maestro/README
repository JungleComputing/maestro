Maestro is a programming framework that executes dataflow computations on
malleable sets of Ibis nodes. The system is `self-organizing'. That is,
apart from a specialized 'maestro' node that inserts work in the system,
all nodes are equal, and they distribute the work among themselves based
on the performance of the nodes for different tasks and the performance of
the communication channels between them. There is no central scheduler.

Computations are called 'jobs', and each job consists of a series of
'tasks' that are arranged in a pipeline. Each task can be 'atomic':
indivisible, or a 'map-reduce' task that generates a series of
job instances whose output is `reduced' into a single result for the
entire map-reduce task.
