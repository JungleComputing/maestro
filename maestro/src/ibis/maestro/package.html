A dataflow programming environment for Ibis.
<p>
A Maestro program consists of a set of computational steps,
called <em>tasks</em> that are grouped into <em>jobs</em>:
sequences of tasks that are executed sequentially.
The program is executed by a set of <em>nodes</em> running
on separate (possibly multiprocessor or multicore) computers. Each node
tries to submit its tasks to the node that is the most efficient
in executing it, based on the completion time  of all
remaining tasks in the job.
</p>
<p>
In its simplest form a task is <em>atomic</em> (indivisible),
and is implemented by any class that implements the
<code>AtomicTask</code> interface. By default Maestro assumes
that every instance of a particular task requires the same execution
time, so that the performance of the different nodes in
the system can be compared. The user can help
Maestro by implementing the <code>TaskExecutionTimeEstimator</code>
to provide an initial estimate of the execution time. 
Maestro also supports tasks with unpredictable execution
times. These tasks are labeled with the <code>UnpredictableAtomicTask</code>
interface. For such tasks only the initial estimate is used.
</p>
<p>
Next to atomic tasks Maestro also supports map/reduce tasks,
where the <code>map</code> method submits a number of jobs
to the system, the <code>reduce</code> method processes the
results of these jobs, and the <code>getResult</code> method
returns the final result after all job results have been processed.
